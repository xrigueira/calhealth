An Annotation_Code of 1 denotes non-zero counts less than 11 suppressed due to small numbers, and an Annotation_Code of 2 denotes a cell suppressed as a complementary cell.\r\n\r\nSuppression is applied to complementary cells across all stratifications, including across all months for each year. Since annual counts will be provided once provisional data is finalized, complementary cells are suppressed across the months for each year even when annual counts have not yet been provided.",
  "description": "This dataset contains counts of live births for California counties based on information entered on birth certificates. Final counts are derived from static data and include out of state births to California residents, whereas provisional counts are derived from incomplete and dynamic data. Provisional counts are based on the records available when the data was retrieved and may not represent all births that occurred during the time period.\r\n\r\nThe final data tables include both births that occurred in California regardless of the place of residence (by occurrence) and births to California residents (by residence), whereas the provisional data table only includes births that occurred in California regardless of the place of residence (by occurrence). The data are reported as totals, as well as stratified by parent giving birth's age, parent giving birth's race-ethnicity, and birth place type.
